# CreditCardValidity

This project validates a credit card number using the Luhn's Algorithm. It currently only works with Mastercard, Visa, and Discover cards. I mainly coded this project because it is an interesting way of learning about the Luhn's Algorithm and how to work with credit cards. 

This project is still a work in progress. I would like to add more functionality to it but this is what I have so far
